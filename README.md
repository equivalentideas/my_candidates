## My Candidates

The goal (as yet unrealised) is this for to be a simple static site that lists all known candidates for the upcoming Australian federal election in July 2016.

### Done:

* Scraper that sources electorates and the postcodes within them.
* Scraper that sources a list of federal political parties.

### In progress:

* Construct a Google spreadsheet that will be the source of candidates, which can then be turned into popolo data (much like https://github.com/openaustralia/australian_local_councillors_popolo).

### To do:

* Add a Google form to help source candidate data (name, party, electorate, social media links, perhaps a photo).
* Write code to generate pages for each postcode and electorate. If a postcode only has one electorate, redirect to that electorate. If it has more than one, offer the viewer a choice.
* Add meaningful layouts and design.
* On electorate pages, include a link to the Google form to allow people to suggest missing candidates.
* Get some decent candidate data together so the site isn't empty.
